### Sample Prompts

#### 1. Initial Project Setup

**Prompt**:  
_Create a Modern SaaS Landing Page & Component System for a fictional AI-powered marketing tool called 'ADmyBRAND AI Suite'. Include Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials Carousel, FAQ, Footer sections with 2025 design trends like glassmorphism, subtle animations, modern typography, smooth scrolling, mobile-first responsiveness._

**AI Response**:  
Generated complete project structure using Next.js 14+, App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and created all necessary UI sections with advanced design patterns.

#### 2. Component Enhancement

**Prompt**:  
_Fix the slider – it's not visible and make it smooth with better UI design. Also fix the pricing calculator layout to match the site's theme._

**AI Response**:  
Redesigned the slider with custom CSS, improved user interaction, and enhanced layout consistency for the pricing calculator component.

#### 3. Advanced Features Implementation

**Prompt**:  
_Implement bonus features: Interactive Pricing Calculator, Demo Video/Animation Section, Blog/Resources Section, Advanced Animations (Framer Motion)._

**AI Response**:  
Built dynamic pricing calculator with real-time state management, modal video sections with Framer Motion, animated background layers, and fully styled blog/resource sections.

### AI vs Manual Work Split

####  AI-Generated (~85%)

- React + TypeScript components
- Tailwind CSS styling and layout
- Framer Motion animations and effects
- Pricing logic, form validation, and state handling
- Design system setup (color palette, spacing, typography)
- Responsive design patterns with breakpoint management

---

####  Manual Work (~15%)

- Fixed build errors and TypeScript issues
- Adjusted layout inconsistencies (padding, spacing, alignment)
- Fixed UI bugs missed by AI
- Set up routing and dynamic/static page linking
- Initialized project structure and created folders/files
- Installed and configured necessary packages
- Added missing content and tweaked visual elements
- Incorporated feedback and made iterative design adjustments
- Fixed animation glitches and modal interaction issues
- Aligned new features to the existing design system
- Conducted UI testing across devices and browsers

### Challenges & Solutions

| **Challenge**                        | **Problem**                                              | **Solution**                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slider visibility                   | Sliders not rendering correctly across browsers          | Redesigned with dual layers and enhanced styles                            |
| Design mismatch                     | Components visually inconsistent                         | Unified design with consistent Tailwind tokens and themes                 |
| Modal close bugs                    | Multiple close buttons creating confusion                | Streamlined modal with a single accessible close action                   |
| Build errors (manual fix)           | Type conflicts and missing dependencies                  | Manually corrected TypeScript definitions and dependency configs          |
| Layout issues (manual fix)          | Unwanted padding/margin and responsiveness glitches      | Resolved using Tailwind spacing utilities and responsive tweaks           |

### Development Impact

-  **Faster Development** – Time reduced from days to hours for UI features  
-  **Consistent Design** – Pixel-perfect results aligned with branding  
-  **Fewer Bugs** – AI helped catch syntax and logic issues early  
-  **Reusable Components** – Modular code allowed for quick iteration  
-  **Accessibility Compliance** – ARIA roles and focus management included
